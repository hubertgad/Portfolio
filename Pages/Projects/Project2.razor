        <h3>What?</h3>
        <span>
            This is my first published project in ASP.NET. This project is more academic than practical, real-world application.
            <b>Repeat</b> allow to create tests containing multi-choice questions and share them for other users. An user can take a test and see the summary with test result afterwards.
